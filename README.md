### Sample ASP.NET Core Web API with Keycloak Authentication

This repository provides a sample setup for a simple **ASP.NET Core Web API** that uses **Keycloak** for authentication and **PostgreSQL** as the database. Additionally, it includes integration with **OpenTelemetry** for telemetry collection and **Jaeger** for tracing.

#### Key Components:
- **ASP.NET Core Web API** – A foundational project for building RESTful APIs.
- **Keycloak** – An authentication and authorization system supporting OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.
- **PostgreSQL** – A relational database used to store user data and other information.
- **OpenTelemetry** – A framework for collecting metrics and traces.
- **Jaeger** – A distributed tracing system for monitoring application performance.

#### Features:
- Authentication and authorization using **Keycloak**.
- Use of **PostgreSQL** as the data store.
- Collection of telemetry and tracing with **OpenTelemetry**, and visualization of traces in **Jaeger**.

#### Usage:
This project serves as a base example for building APIs with modern authentication and monitoring tools. It is suitable for educational purposes and can be used as a quick-start for projects.
